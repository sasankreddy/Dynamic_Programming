## Introduction

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique for solving problems that involve overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. This repository contains my solutions to a variety of DP-based problems, where I used different methods such as top-down (memoization), bottom-up (tabulation), and space optimization strategies to solve the problems efficiently.

The repository is organized by problems, and each file contains a solution along with a brief explanation of the approach, the time and space complexities, and the reasoning behind the solution.

## Problem Solutions

Below are some of the key problems that are solved in this repository:

- **Climbing Stairs**
- **House Robber**
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence**
- **Knapsack Problem**
- **Palindrome Partitioning**
- **Word Break**
- **Max Profit from Stock Prices**
- **Unique Paths**
- **Jump Game**
- **Edit Distance**

Each problem is implemented in a separate Python file under the `solutions/` folder.

## Approach

Each problem includes the following:

1. **Problem Statement**: A brief explanation of the problem and what needs to be achieved.
2. **Solution Approach**: The approach used to solve the problem, including the choice of Dynamic Programming techniques, optimization, and trade-offs.
3. **Code**: Python code implementing the solution using Dynamic Programming.
4. **Time and Space Complexity**: A detailed explanation of the time and space complexities of the solution, as well as how it scales with the input.

## Time and Space Complexity

Each solution is optimized to minimize both **time** and **space** complexity. Generally, the time complexity depends on the number of subproblems and the number of states, while space complexity depends on the storage required for memoization or tabulation tables.

Here is a breakdown of typical complexities for Dynamic Programming problems:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) or O(n^2), depending on the problem.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) or O(n^2), optimized by using one-dimensional arrays when possible.
